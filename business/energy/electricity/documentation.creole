**This category is now deprecated. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol data, together with historical values, can now be found [[Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol_international_electricity|here]]**

The AMEE category at /business/energy/electricity includes data and a calculation methodology for greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production and consumption of grid electricity by specific country and other international jurisdictions. Data on CO,,2,, emissions is sourced from the WRI [[Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol|Greenhouse Gas Protocol]] [[http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools|worksheet]] for //GHG emissions from Purchased Electricity, Heat or Steam//, which based on data published by the International Energy Agency [[http://www.iea.org/index.asp|IEA]]. Emissions factors for CH,,4,, and N,,2,,O emissions data is sourced from the US [[http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/excel/electricity_factors_99-02country.xls|EIA]].

To use this category, set the country or international region using the //**country**// drill choice. Next, set the quantity of electricity consumed by setting the //**energyPerTime**// profile item value. The returned quantity represents CO,,2,,e emissions associated with the energy quantity and country/region specified.

The GHG protocol worksheets additionally provide functionality for the accounting of electricity usage in shared facilities. AMEE replicates this functionality by allowing users to specify the proportion of floor area which is under consideration (e.g. square feet of office space). To use this functionality, specify the 'responsible' and total areas using the //**responsibleArea**// and //**totalArea**// profile item values. The returned value represents only the share of emissions which are attributable to the user on the basis of floor area share.
