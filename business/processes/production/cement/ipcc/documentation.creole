  The AMEE category /business/processes/production/cement/ipcc contains several methodologies sourced from the the IPCC guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories ([[http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/3_Volume3/V3_2_Ch2_Mineral_Industry.pdf|NGGIP]]) related to the production of cement.

===Cement production-based methodology===
 The AMEE category [[IPCC_cement_production_based_on_production|business/processes/production/cement/ipcc/cement]] provides a methodology based on the quantity of cement produced and represents the //Tier 1// approach described by the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories ([[http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html|NGGIP]]). This methodology should be used where no information on clinker production or the consumption of raw carbonate materials are available. The methodology estimates emissions from the production of clinker based on data describing production of cement together with default values representing typical cement properties.

===Clinker production-based methodology===
 The AMEE category [[IPCC_cement_production_based_on_clinker|business/processes/production/cement/ipcc/clinker]] provides a methodology based on the quantity and properties of clinker produced and represents the //Tier 2// approach described by the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories ([[http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html|NGGIP]]). This methodology should be used where no information on the consumption of raw carbonate materials are available, but data on clinker production is available.

===Carbonate inputs-based methodology===
 The AMEE category [[IPCC_cement_production_based_on_carbonate_inputs|business/processes/production/cement/ipcc/carbonate]] provides a methodology using specific quantities of various carbonate species - the primary source of carbon - for calculating CO,,2,, emissions, and represents the //Tier 3// approach described by the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories ([[http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html|NGGIP]]).
