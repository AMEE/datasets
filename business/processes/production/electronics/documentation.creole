   The AMEE category /business/processes/production/electronics contains data and methodologies for calculating greenhouse gas emissions associated with the electronics industry.

There currently exists two main subcategories which deal with the plasma etching of silicon containing materials, cleaning of chemical vapour deposition (CVD) tool chamber-walls and the use of heat transfer fluids in the semiconductor, LCD and photovoltaic industries.

See the following subcategory for further details.
