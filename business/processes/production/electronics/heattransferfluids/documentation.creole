  The AMEE category /business/processes/production/electronics/heattransferfluids contains data and calculation methodologies for the emissions associated with the use of heat transfer fluids in the electronics industry.

See the following subcategories for further details:

===Production-based methodology===
The AMEE category at [[Heat_transfer_fluids_production_methodology|business/processes/production/electronics/heattransferfluids/production]] provides a methodology based on the quantity of semiconductor substrate produced. This methodology represents the //Tier 1// approach described by the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories ([[http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html|NGGIP]]).

===Consumption-based methodology===
 The AMEE category at [[Heat_transfer_fluids_consumption_methodology|business/processes/production/electronics/heattransferfluids/consumption]] provides a methodology based on a mass-balance accounting of heat transfer fluid usage over a specified period. This methodology represents the //Tier 2// approach described by the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories ([[http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html|NGGIP]]).
