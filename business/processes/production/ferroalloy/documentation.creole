 The AMEE category business/processes/production/ferroalloy for calculating greenhouse gas emissions from ferroalloy production. These methodologies are sourced from the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories ([[http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html|NGGIP]]). See the following subcategories for further details.

===Production-based methodology=== 
The AMEE category [[Generic_ferroalloy_production|/business/processes/production/ferroalloy/production]] contains data and a methodology based on generic emission factors for each ferroalloy type related to the quantity of ferroalloy produced. The methodology represents the //Tier 1// (default values) approach described by the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories ([[http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html|NGGIP]]).

===Raw materials-based methodology=== 
The AMEE category [[Ferroalloy_raw_materials_methodology|/business/processes/production/ferroalloy/rawmaterials]] contains data and a methodology based raw material inputs to the ferroalloy production process. The methodology represents the //Tier 2// and //Tier 3// approaches described by the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories ([[http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html|NGGIP]]).

===Ferroalloy methane emissions===
The AMEE category [[Ferroalloy_methane_emissions|/business/processes/production/ferroalloy/ch4]] contains data and a methodology for calculating methane emissions associated with ferroalloy production. The methodology represents the //Tier 1// and //Tier 2// approaches described by the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories ([[http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html|NGGIP]]).
