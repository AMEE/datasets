   The AMEE category /business/processes/production/glass contains data and methodologies for calculating the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production of glass. Two subcategories are currently available, which provide two methodologies sourced from the IPCC [[http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/|Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories]].

The [[Generic_glass_production|Generic glass production]] category provides data for the manufacture of generic, representative type of glass.

The [[Glass_production_carbonate_methodology|Glass production carbonate methodology]] category uses specific quantities of various carbonate species - used as feedstock in the glass industry and the primary source of carbon - for calculating CO,,2,, emissions.
