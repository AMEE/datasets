  The AMEE category business/processes/production/magnesium contains data and methodologies for calculating greenhouse gas emissions associated with magnesium production. See the appropriate subcategories for further details.

===Primary magnesium production===
The AMEE category [[Magnesium_primary_production|business/processes/production/magnesium/primaryproduction]] contains a methodology based on default emission factors for use in situations where facility or site-specific data is not available and represents the //Tier 1// (default values) and //Tier 2// (facility- or country-specific values) approaches described by the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories ([[http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html|NGGIP]]).

===Casting processes===
The AMEE category [[Magnesium_casting_process|business/processes/production/magnesium/castingprocess]] contains a methodology for calculating SF,,6,, emissions from the magnesium casting process segment. The methodology provided by this category represents the //Tier 1// (default values) and //Tier 2// (facility- or country-specific values) approaches described by the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories ([[http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html|NGGIP]]).
