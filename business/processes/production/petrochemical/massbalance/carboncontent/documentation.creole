   The AMEE category at /business/processes/production/petrochemical/massbalance/carboncontent contains data on the carbon contents of feedstocks, products and by-products relating to the petrochemical industry. The category used by the AMEE category /business/processes/production/petrochemical/massbalance as reference for default carbon content values. The data is sourced from volumes 2 and 3 of the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories ([[http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl|NGGIP]]). 

The petrochemical materials are sourced from Volume 3, [[http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/3_Volume3/V3_3_Ch3_Chemical_Industry.pdf|Chapter 3]] which focuses on greenhouse gas emissions associated with the chemical industry.

Several of the fuel types are taken from Volume 2, [[http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/2_Volume2/V2_1_Ch1_Introduction.pdf|Chapter 1]] which focuses on energy production and consumption and provides data for a comprehensive list of fuels. The //mass//-based carbon contents found in this category, were derived from the documented //energy-based carbon content// (kg per GJ) and //energy per mass// (i.e. 'net calorific value'; TJ per Gg) data.

This category cannot be used to create profile items.
