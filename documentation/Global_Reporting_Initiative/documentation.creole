The [[http://www.globalreporting.org/Home|Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)]] is a widely used sustainability reporting framework which sets out the principles and indicators that organizations can use to measure and report their economic, environmental, and social performance. AMEE provides an excellent level of support for GRI compliance.

Emissions related reporting requirements are documented in the [[http://www.globalreporting.org/NR/rdonlyres/D2BC0DF8-FF2C-4BAB-B2B4-27DA868C2A5F/2800/smallG3_IP_EN_ENG_andcov.pdf|'Environment']] category of the Indicator Protocols Set. GRI recommends that reporters use the methodologies of the [[http://www.ghgprotocol.org/|Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP)]] and/or the [[http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/index.html|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)]] to calculate greenhouse gas emissions. AMEE supports the IPCC-NGGIP and the GHGP recommended datasets (which, in many cases, ultimately derives from the IPCC), with new data being added on a continual basis.

To discover data and calculation methodologies which can provide support for the GRI see the following pages:
