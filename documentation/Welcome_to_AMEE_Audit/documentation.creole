* **3 December 2010** - AMEE has upgraded its coverage of [[US_Subregion_Electricity|grid electricity]] in the United States by adding data representing the subregions of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC). 
* **1 December 2010** - AMEE has restructured a large part of its transport support making these data and methodologies easier to discover and use. See the [[DEFRA_DECC|DEFRA]], [[Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol|Greenhouse Gas Protocol]] and [[IPCC]] pages to browse the new transport pages. 
* **29 November 2010** - //Life Cycle Analysis (LCA)// data from the //ecoinvent Centre// is now available in its entirety via AMEEdiscover and the AMEE API. For more details, check out the dedicated [[Ecoinvent_database|Ecoinvent]] AMEEdiscover page.
* **24 November 2010** - AMEE now supports multiple calculation outputs. A large number of AMEE methodologies therefore now return emissions quantities differentiated into specific greenhouse gases (e.g. CO,,2,,, CH,,4,,, N,,2,,O, CO,,2,,e) as well as other useful information. See [[Passenger_transport_by_Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol|this]] example for an idea of this new functionality.
