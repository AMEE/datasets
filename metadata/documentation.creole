 ==Metadata==

This category should contain just one profile item which is used to store information about the profile. For example, which country it relates to or whether it is for an individual or household.

The **//country//** profile item value is important as it will determine the electricity factor used for any electrical appliances stored in the profile and also the values used for certain forms of transport, e.g. for a particular **//size//** of car (e.g. large in the UK and US have different meanings). The country can be set to any of the drill down options in [[Electricity_by_country]] or [[Electricity_by_country_ISO_code]]. If unset, it defaults to United Kingdom.

The **//peopleInHousehold//** profile item value determines the default usages in subcategories of [[Cooking]] as well as the kettle and microwave items in [[Kitchen]] and water heating in [[Heating_uk]].

All other item values are for information only at present and the free text ones can be used to hold information in a format of your choice.
