    The category /transport/bus/generic/ghgp contains data on bus-associated emissions sourced from the latest World Resources Institute [[http://www.ghgprotocol.org/about-ghgp|Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP)]] documentation.This category includes emissions methodologies for bus travel in several geographic contexts, and includes both //per vehicle// and //per passenger// emissions factors. This category also features separate functionality for calculating biofuel emissions.
