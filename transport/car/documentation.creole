          The AMEE category /transport/car contains data associated with the greenhouse gas emissions of car travel. Both generic and specific datasets and methodologies are available in the following subcategories.


==Generic car transport==
The AMEE category [[Generic_car_transport|Generic car transport]] contains data associated with the greenhouse gas emissions of representative car types, e.g. 'small, diesel' or 'large, petrol' cars, sourced from the [[http://www.epa.gov/|EPA]] in the US, and [[http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/conversion-factors.htm|DEFRA]], and the [[http://www.vca.gov.uk/|VCA]] in the UK. This category measures CO,,2,, emissions only, and should be considered to represent a useful first point of entry to car-related emissions. This category is used by the UK Goverment [[http://actonco2.direct.gov.uk/actonco2/home.html|Act On CO,,2,,]] website.

==Generic car transport - DEFRA==
The AMEE [[Generic_car_transport_Defra|DEFRA Generic car transport]] category contains the most recently published [[http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/conversion-factors.htm|DEFRA]] data on greenhouse gas emissions associated with representative car types in UK. The methodology uses distance-based, //per passenger// emissions factors, requiring the user to specify the distance travelled. This category includes CO,,2,,, CH,,4,, and N,,2,,O emissions as part of each calculation.

==Generic car transport - IPCC==
The category [[Generic_car_transport_IPCC|IPCC car transport]] contains data on car-associated emissions  sourced from the IPCC [[http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/|Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories]]. This category contains data and methodologies for European and US contexts and calclulates emissions on per vehicle/per passenger basis, using fuel consumption or a combination of fuel consumption, fuel efficiency and distance.

==Generic car transport - GHG Protocol==
The category [[Generic_car_transport_GHGP|GHGP car transport]] contains data on car-associated emissions sourced from the latest World Resources Institute [[http://www.ghgprotocol.org/about-ghgp|Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP)]] documentation. This category includes emissions methodologies for travel in several geographic contexts, and includes both //per vehicle// and //per passenger// functionality. 

==Specific car transport==
The AMEE category [[Specific_car_transport|Specific car transport]] contains data associated with the greenhouse gas emissions of specific models of motor vehicle sold in the UK and US.

==Car transport by band==
The AMEE category [[Car_transport_by_band|Car transport by band]] contains data associated with the greenhouse gas emissions of generic size categories of motor vehicles used in the Republic of Ireland.
