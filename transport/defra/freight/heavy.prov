The data for indirect emissions were based on ratios of direct to indirect emissions associated with the fuel production cycle taken from prov:numeric http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/pdf/101006-guidelines-ghg-conversion-factors-method-paper.pdf#'Annex%201%20Fuel%20Conversion%20Factors'!

Indirect emissions were based on ratios of direct to indirect emissions associated with the fuel production cycle taken from prov:numeric http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/pdf/101006-guidelines-ghg-conversion-factors-method-paper.pdf#'Annex%201%20Fuel%20Conversion%20Factors'!

The tonne-km emissions factors for rail in prov:out http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/pdf/100805-guidelines-ghg-conversion-factors.xls#'Annex%207%20Freight%20Transport'!B194:Q202 were derived from a prov:calculation based on prov:numeric http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/pdf/YEARBOOK0809-v22.pdf#Table9.1 and known ratios of CO2 emissions to CH4 and N2O emissions taken from prov:numeric nouri:"UK Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990 to 2008". Plane data was based upon several sources. based on several sources. Aircraft-specific fuel consumption data was sourced from prov:in http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/EMEPCORINAIR4/B851vs2.4.pdf and prov:numeric http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/EMEPCORINAIR4/B851_annex.zip . Average seating capacities, load factors and proportions of passenger-kms by different aircraft types for the year 2008 were provided by the prov:by nouri:"Civil Aviation Authority (CAA)" , and data on freight capacities for dedicated freight and passenger aircraft were taken from prov:in http://www.baworldcargo.com/configs/ and prov:numeric http://www.baworldcargo.com/configs/BAWCconfigurations.pdf . A 10% 'uplift' factor was applied to account for discrepancies between national bunker fuel inventories (reported un the UNFCCC) and 'bottom-up' fuel consumption calculations by prov:by nouri:"Department for Transport" and prov:by nouri:"National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory" using the CORINAIR flight methodology and activity data for the UK (aircraft types and routes) from CAA. CH4 and N2O emissions data was derived from the CO2 data on the basis of the known ratios of CO2 emissions to CH4 and N2O emissions according to prov:numeric nouri:"UK Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990 to 2008". All indirect emissions data were based on the known ratios of direct to indirect emissions associated with the fuel production cycle and electricity consumption (for rail) taken from prov:numeric http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/pdf/101006-guidelines-ghg-conversion-factors-method-paper.pdf#'Annex%201%20Fuel%20Conversion%20Factors'! and prov:numeric http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/pdf/101006-guidelines-ghg-conversion-factors-method-paper.pdf#'Annex%203%20Electricity%20Factors'! respectively.

The tonne-km emissions factors for ferries in prov:out http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/pdf/100805-guidelines-ghg-conversion-factors.xls#'Annex%207%20Freight%20Transport'!B220:Q276 were derived from a prov:calculation based on prov:in nouri:"Carbon emissions of mixed passenger and vehicle ferries on UK and domestic routes", whereas those for other modes of maritime transport were based upon prov:numeric http://www.imo.org/OurWork/Environment/PollutionPrevention/AirPollution/Documents/GHGStudyFINAL.pdf#Table9.1 . CH4 and N2O emissions derived from known ratios of CO2 emissions to CH4 and N2O emissions provided by prov:numeric nouri:"UK Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990 to 2008", and indirect emissions were similarly based on the known ratios of direct to indirect emissions associated with the fuel production cycle taken from prov:numeric http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/pdf/101006-guidelines-ghg-conversion-factors-method-paper.pdf#'Annex%201%20Fuel%20Conversion%20Factors'! .
