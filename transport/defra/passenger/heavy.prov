Direct CH4 and N2O emissions data for all buses was based on prov:numeric nouri:"UK Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990 to 2008". Direct CO2 emissions for national rail were based upon prov:numeric http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/pdf/YEARBOOK0809-v22.pdf#Table9.1 , while the corresponding CH4 and N2O emissions were derived from the known ratio of CO2 emissions to CH4 and N2O emissions for electricity and diesel rail based on prov:numeric nouri:"UK Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990 to 2008" as well as information on the relative passenger-km proportions of diesel and electric rail provided by prov:by nouri:"Department for Transport". International rail data was based on CO2 emissons factors based on prov:numeric http://www.eurostar.com/UK/uk/leisure/about_eurostar/environment/greener_than_flying.jsp as well as the known ratios of CO2 emissions to CH4 and N2O emissions assocated with electricity consumption taken from prov:numeric http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/pdf/101006-guidelines-ghg-conversion-factors-method-paper.pdf#'Annex%2010%20Overseas%20Electricity'! and prov:numeric http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/pdf/101006-guidelines-ghg-conversion-factors-method-paper.pdf#'Annex%203%20Electricity%20Factors'! . Light rail direct emissions were based on electricity consumption and passenger-km data provided by the prov:in nouri:"Transport for London, Environment Report 2010" (DLR, London Overground, Croydon Tramlink) and other prov:in anonymous:"Network operators" (Glasgow Underground, Midland Metro, Type and Wear Metro, Manchester Metrolink, Supertram) as well as direct emissions factors for CO2, CH4 and N2O from prov:numeric http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/pdf/101006-guidelines-ghg-conversion-factors-method-paper.pdf#'Annex%203%20Electricity%20Factors'! .
