The vehicle-km emissions factors for petrol cars in prov:out http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/pdf/100805-guidelines-ghg-conversion-factors.xls#'Annex%206%20Passenger%20Transport'!B146:O167 were derived from a prov:calculation based on New European Driving Cycle emissions testing data and UK fleet mix statistics sourced from prov:by nouri:"Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders" (which represents the UK auto industry) and provided by prov:by nouri:"Energy Savings Trust". An 'uplift' for the effects of 'real-world' driving (air-con, lights, payload, poor maintenance) was derived on the basis of prov:in http://www.umweltdaten.de/publikationen/fpdf-k/k3071.pdf called "Investigations for an Amendment of the EU Directive 93/116/EC (Measurement of Fuel Consumption and CO2 Emission). Study by TUEV Nord Mobilitaet GmbH & Co.KG, Institute for Vehicle Technology and Mobility" , corroborated by advice provided by the prov:in nouri:"International Energy Agency" and the prov:in nouri:"Energy Savings Trust" and agreed by prov:by nouri:"Department for Transport". CH4 and N2O emissions factors were derived from ratios of CO2 emissions to CH4 and N2O emissions described in the prov:numeric nouri:"UK Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990 to 2008". Indirect emissions were based on ratios of direct to indirect emissions associated with the fuel production cycle taken from prov:numeric http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/pdf/101006-guidelines-ghg-conversion-factors-method-paper.pdf#'Annex%201%20Fuel%20Conversion%20Factors'!
