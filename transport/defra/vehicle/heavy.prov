An 'uplift' for the effects of 'real-world' driving (air-con, lights, payload, poor maintenance) was derived on the basis of prov:in http://www.umweltdaten.de/publikationen/fpdf-k/k3071.pdf called "Investigations for an Amendment of the EU Directive 93/116/EC (Measurement of Fuel Consumption and CO2 Emission). Study by TUEV Nord Mobilitaet GmbH & Co.KG, Institute for Vehicle Technology and Mobility" , corroborated by advice provided by the prov:in nouri:"International Energy Agency" and the prov:in nouri:"Energy Savings Trust" and agreed by prov:by nouri:"Department for Transport". Emissions factors for 'average' petrol vehicles were derived on the basis of data on the relative percentage of total mileage by petrol and diesel cars taken from the prov:numeric nouri:"UK Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990 to 2008". CH4 and N2O emissions factors were derived from ratios of CO2 emissions to CH4 and N2O emissions described in the prov:numeric nouri:"UK Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990 to 2008". Indirect emissions were based on ratios of direct to indirect emissions associated with the fuel production cycle taken from prov:numeric http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/pdf/101006-guidelines-ghg-conversion-factors-method-paper.pdf#'Annex%201%20Fuel%20Conversion%20Factors'!

Emissions factors for hybrid petrol-electric cars were based on those provided for the main models available in the UK by prov:numeric http://www.vcacarfueldata.org.uk/downloads/ . Data on LPG and CNG vehicles were based on estimates of vehicle emissions relative to similar petrol vehicles published prov:in http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/fleet/technology/alternativefuels/ together with corresponding data on petrol vehicles from prov:numeric prov:out http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/pdf/100805-guidelines-ghg-conversion-factors.xls#'Annex%206%20Passenger%20Transport'!B76:O87 . Average vehicle emissions factors were based on a weighted average using the relative vehicle-km for medium and large cars from the prov:numeric nouri:"UK Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990 to 2008". Due to the significant size and weight of the LPG and CNG fuel tanks, the data was derived using a prov:assumption nouri:"Only medium and large sized CNG and LPG vehicles are available". CH4 and N2O emissions factors were based on the emission factors from the prov:numeric nouri:"UK Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990 to 2008". Indirect emissions were based on ratios of direct to indirect emissions associated with the fuel production cycle taken from prov:numeric http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/pdf/101006-guidelines-ghg-conversion-factors-method-paper.pdf#'Annex%201%20Fuel%20Conversion%20Factors'!
