The vehicle-km emissions factors for heavy goods vehicles in prov:out http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/pdf/100805-guidelines-ghg-conversion-factors.xls#'Annex%207%20Freight%20Transport'!B168:Q183 were derived from a prov:calculation based on several sources. Fuel efficiencies of each vehicle type we based on a prov:numeric http://www.dft.gov.uk/adobepdf/162469/221412/221522/222944/661202/rfs2009.pdf#Table5.1 and converted to distance-based emissions factors using the fuel-based emissions factors for diesel in prov:numeric http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/pdf/101006-guidelines-ghg-conversion-factors-method-paper.pdf#'Annex%201%20Fuel%20Conversion%20Factors'! . Typical freight loading factors for each vehicle type were taken from prov:numeric http://www.dft.gov.uk/adobepdf/162469/221412/221522/222944/661202/rfs2009.pdf#Table1.12 and the effect on fuel efficiency of variations in freight loading was derived from data provided by the prov:numeric nouri:"EU-ARTEMIS project". CH4 and N2O emissions factors were derived from ratios of CO2 emissions to CH4 and N2O emissions described in the on prov:numeric nouri:"UK Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990 to 2008". Indirect emissions were based on ratios of direct to indirect emissions associated with the fuel production cycle taken from prov:numeric http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/pdf/101006-guidelines-ghg-conversion-factors-method-paper.pdf#'Annex%201%20Fuel%20Conversion%20Factors'!
