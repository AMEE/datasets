**This category is deprecated. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodologies for freight transport can now be found [[Freight_transport_by_Greenhouse_Gas_Protocol|here]]**

    The AMEE category /transport/lgv/generic/freight/ghgp contains data on the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the road transportation of freight, sourced from the [[http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools|WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol]].

The data and calculation methodologies within these categories are based on distance- and mass-based emissions factors and therefore represented emissions per quantity of freight transported.

Subcategories are organised by geographic context ('US', 'other' (non-US/UK)). See the relevant subcategory documentation for further details.
