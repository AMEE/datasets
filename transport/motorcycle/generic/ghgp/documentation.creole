   The AMEE category /transport/motorcycle/generic/ghgp contains motorcycle-associated emissions data sourced from the latest [[http://www.ghgprotocol.org/|GHG_Protocol]] documentation. The data and methodologies are organised into subcategories representing car travel in the context of the United States and 'other' (i.e. non-US and non-UK) regions. See the appropriate subcategory for further information.
