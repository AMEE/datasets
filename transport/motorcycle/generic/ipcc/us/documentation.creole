  The AMEE category /transport/motorcycle/generic/ipcc/us contains data on greenhouse gas emissions associated with motorcycle transport in the US, sourced from the IPCC [[http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/|Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories]].

Currently, a methodology for conventionally fuelled motorcycles is available; details can be found [[US_conventional_fuel_motorcycle_transport_IPCC|here]]

The IPCC methodology for greenhouse gas emissions associated with [[http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/2_Volume2/V2_3_Ch3_Mobile_Combustion.pdf|'mobile combustion']] recommend calculating CO,,2,, emissions on the basis of fuel consumed, whereas those of CH,,4,, and N,,2,,O vary more directly with other factors such as vehicle type, emissions control standards, and distance travelled. Therefore, this category provides a number of options for calculating motorcycle-associated greenhouse gas emissions, depending on which combination of fuel consumption, fuel efficiency and distance are specified.
