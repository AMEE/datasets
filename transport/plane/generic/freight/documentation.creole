 The AMEE category /transport/plane/generic/freight contains data on the greenhouse gas emissions associated with plane transported freight sourced from [[http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/economy/business-efficiency/reporting|DEFRA]]. See the [[http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools|WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol]] subcategories for data and methodologies representing other geographic scopes.


To use this category, select the type of flight (domestic, short-haul, long-haul) using the //type// drill down option. Definitions of these, in terms of distance or duration, are given in the [[Generic_plane_transport|Generic plane transport]] documentation. Then, specify the distance and mass of the freight transported by setting the **//distance//** and **//mass//** profile item values. The returned value represents the mass of CO,,2,, emitted in associated with the specified freighting.
